Basic Tool tutorial: Metasploit

In this path you will work with very useful pentester tool - Metasploit.
All challenges are prepared for this tool (of course, there are also some ways how to do it without metasploit but this path is to learn how to work with this tool).
These challenges contain only basic functions of Metasploit like choice of the correct module, correct settings of that module, ...

You need to run metasploit in your host. You can find some installation guides on the Internet. One of them for Linux machine is:
* curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall
* chmod 755 msfinstall
* ./msfinstall
 
All challenges are tested from Linux machine with version 4.14.13-dev of Metasploit Framework and also version 4.14.13-dev of Metasploit console.

I hope you will enjoy these challenges. Good luck and have a nice time!

Important: IP and port in the challenges won't accept netcat connections (despite the message). They are there only for setting correct attributes in modules.
