Your Boss fired the dumb employee. Good job (in a possitive way of course ;) ).
Now something harder. In the enterprise there are some rumours about vulnerability in the system.
Something like bash problem? A lot of systems had problem with this vulnerability a few years ago or they still have it.
Could you test our system if it is vulnerable? In the rumours it was mentioned something like filename vuln.

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
