Wow! Good job! Now you know how to run this magical tool. But your Boss does not want only starting the Metasploit Framework. He wants also to work with it. Next step is to scan some host. It could be vulnerable. Can you try to use some tool by metasploit or payload/exploit to scan that host? 
Good chance!

Your flag is service running on a port. (If you see service filtered please restart the challenge.)
Tip: try to use external tool through Metasploit.

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
