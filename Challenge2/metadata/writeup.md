Active scanner.

## What could be useful to run?

Try to use Nmap tool.

## How to set it properly?

Cost: 50%

run into metasploit console:
```bash
nmap -sV IP_address
```

## Complete solution

We want to see running services therefore we need parameter -sV in nmap -> probe open ports to determine service/version info
When you run the command above you will see running ssh service at port 666. So the flag is: ssh.
