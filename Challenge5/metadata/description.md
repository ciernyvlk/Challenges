Good job!
You are master of crawling. Now something harder. Your Boss knows that he has some dumb
employees. Could you help him to retrieve password of user "dumb"? He knows only username and
that this user works with tomcat service. But that all.
It is up to you.
Your flag will be password of this dumb user.
PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
