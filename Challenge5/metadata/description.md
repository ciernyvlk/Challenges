Your Boss fired the dumb employee. Good job (in a possitive way of course ;) ).
Now something more hard. In the enterprise are some rumors about vulnerability in system.
Something like bash problem? A lot of systems had or have problem with this vulnerability a few years ago.
Could you test our system if it is vulnerable? In the rumors was mentioned something like file vuln.
