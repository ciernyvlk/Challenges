Nice job. Now you know how to scan target host. Your next job is to find all active websites
on the IP_address. Are you bolt enough to do that?
The flag could be somewhere in the webpages or plugins or â€¦

Tip: you do not have to do it manually.

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
