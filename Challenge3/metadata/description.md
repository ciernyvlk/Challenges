Your Boss thinks that scanning through nmap was too easy. Could you try to scan it another way?

In the vulnerable host you can find some service (this service is running on UDP port) to use for next step. Try to find out as much information as possible and I guarantee you that the flag will be between that info. For the second step I recommend you to use module related to service running on a UDP port. 

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
