Your Boss thinks that scanning through nmap was too easy. Could you try to scan it another way?

In the vulnerable host you can find some service or vulnerability to use for next step. Try to find out as much information as possible and I guarantee you that the flag will be between that info.

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
