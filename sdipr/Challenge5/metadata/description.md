Good job!
You are already a crawling Master. Now we’ll try something harder. Your boss knows there are “dumb” employees in the company. Can you help him to find out the password for \textbf{dumb}? user? He knows only his login and the fact that the user works with Tomcat and its complements. That’s all and i tis up to you how you’ll face it. Your task is to find out the credentials.

The flag for this task is the password of “dumb” user. 

In this case, you will work with vulnerability CVE-1999-0502 the core of which is the use of standard or no login credentials.  

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
