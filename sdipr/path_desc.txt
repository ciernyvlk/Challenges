In this path you will work with very useful pentester tool - Metasploit. All
challenges are prepared for this tool (of course, there are also some other
ways how to do it without Metasploit but this path is to learn how to work with
this tool).

Metasploit is very powerful tool using by pentesters. It offers a lot of
modules for scanning, gathering information, exploiting, post-exploiting etc.
It offers also to build own modules, use a lot of encoders to avoid detection
ad also toolkit for social engineering. Some documentation you can found here:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/metasploit/ 

You need to run metasploit in your host. You can find some installation guides
for Linux host on official Metasploit site: https://www.metasploit.com/download. All
challenges are tested from Linux machine with version 4.14.13-dev of Metasploit
Framework
and also version 4.14.13-dev of Metasploit console. 

I hope you will enjoy these challenges. Good luck and have a nice
time! 


Important: IP and port in the challenges won't accept netcat connections
(despite the message). They are there only for setting correct attributes in
modules.
