Excellent, now you know how you can scan the host. Your next task is to find all active pages and complements on IP address. Can you do it?
The flag is hidden somewhere between webpages or plugins, or… 

Advise: You don’t have to do it manually. There are methods that allow you to do it automatically. These methods search recursively by opening hyperlinks available on the page which are being saved after opening into the visited pages and they are not opened anymore. This search method enables to set up the depth of visited pages: whether the links out of examined IP address should be searched, etc.  

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
