Well done! Now you know how to run this magical tool. Nevertheless, your boss needs you to know how to work with it. Next step is to scan some host. It can be vulnerable. Try to use some tool to scan this host. It is one of the most popular and widely used tools for scanning that works outside Metasploit as well. You need to set the settings correctly. Good luck.

Your flag is service running on a port.
Scanning is very important part of every penetration test. There are more types of scanning. Horizontal scanning is scanning of various IP addresses for certain port. Vertical scanning, on the other hand, is scanning of one IP address on various ports.

In this case we have only IP address available, thus we use vertical scanning. It allows us to find open ports on examined host, tasks running on the ports and many other information needful for further steps.

PS: Do not forget, that the IP and port below won't accept netcat connections (despite the message).
